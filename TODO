  CRITICAL BUGS:
* Go through a teleporter by sidestepping into it and shoot a grenade instantly after you
  spawn. All grenades you shoot afterwards will be off the crosshair.
* Some func_door's do not stop playing their sound for moving, particularly observed in e2m2
  on the big platform that raises upwards slowly, and in end.bsp where the big spike/crush
  trap is.

DMM4: 3 minutes.
Spawns are not random enough.
Hitsounds are too frequent.
Fix gibs.

Stats presentation.
Preserve frags for disconnected players.
Support some of the generally used KT* commands: /shownick, /list, /whonot, /no_gl, /no_lg, +wp_stats
Add a randommap function.

NOTE: Somewhat supports mvdsv up until 0.25 except for mapvoting that has to be done with
      /cmd votemap, 0.26 introduces broken downloads and missing support for
      KRIMZON_SV_PARSECLIENTCOMMAND
